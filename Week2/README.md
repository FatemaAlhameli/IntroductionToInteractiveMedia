**Animation, Conditionals, Loops**

## Class 2 - Part 1
### Feb 1 - 1:15pm - 3:55pm

**Submitting your homework**
* Create a sketch on the p5 editor
* Document your process, nxt steps, challenges, discoveries on github using markdown
* Make sure that this is done by 12 noon on Monday

**Recap**
* Variables
* frameCount and frameRate
* angleMode

**Topics covered in class**

* Conditionals
  * You would use a conditional (if-else) when you want certain blocks of code to run only when a certain condition is satisfied
  * Syntax is as follows
  ```
  if(customCondition) {
    //What code to run if the condition is satisfied
  }
  else {
    //What code to run if the above condition is not satisfied
  }
  ```
  * Try if else by drawing different coloured ellipses on different halves of the canvas
  * We can now use the `mouseIsPressed` variable to create interactions when the mouse is pressed
  * NOTE: You can also use the mousePressed() function. Note that there is a huge difference between the mouseIsPressed variable and the mousePressed() function: the variable mousePressed is true as long as any mouse button is pressed, while the function mousePressed() is called only once whenever a mouse button is pressed, no matter how long it's pressed for
  * **TODO** : if mouse is pressed, change the colour of the canvas! (Can pressing in different areas call for different background colours)
  * **TODO** : Continuing on the above, can we make a button?
  * Multiple conditions! In case of multiple conditions, we will use the `else if` conditional
  * **TODO** : can we make multiple buttons?
  * We can use the if statements to now make a bouncing ball!

* Loops
  * Loops are used to repeat code
  * There are 2 kinds of loops we will be looking at - `for` loops and `while` loops.
* For loops
* **TODO**: use while loop to draw 10 ellipses on the screen
* Nested loops
* **TODO**: use while loop to draw 100 ellipses on the screen!
* **Be careful of infinite loops!!**

* Random function
  * `random(x,y)` - gives a random number between x and y.
  * If you want a whole number, you can use `floor(random(x,y))`

**Notes from class**
* Make sure to always indent your code!
* When creating variables make sure to give them meaningful names.
* Try and use variables as much as possible. Eg- to detemine the size of an ellipse, the distance between jumps in for loops.


## Class 2 - Part 2
### Feb 3 - 2:40pm - 3:55pm

**Topics covered in class**

* While loops - a quick look
  * The syntax for while loops is similar to `if` statement. The main difference is that, in a `if` block, the code inside runs once after the condition is checked. In a `while` loop, the code inside the while block runs as long as the condition is satisfied before leaving the code block.
  ``` 
  while(condition) {
    //code goes here
  }
  ```

* Other Functions we can use!
  * random function *completed in previous class*
  * noise function 
  * sin

* Noise function
  * Perlin noise is a random sequence generator producing a more naturally ordered, harmonic succession of numbers compared to the standard random() function.
  * [Perlin noise reference](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/noise)
  * TODO : Make a 1-D perlin noise space to change the size of an ellipse / make a wave
  * TODO : Make a 2-D perlin noise space to get a greyscale screen!

* Sin function
  * You can also use the sin wave to ease animations
  * TODO : make a sine wave (remember, you can use `angleMode(DEGREES)`) 
  * TODO : use it to gradually change the colour/size in your previous sketches

* IF time permits - translation and rotation

**Examples for Class 2**
* You can find the examples under ["Week_2" in the p5 editor collection](https://editor.p5js.org/itp42/collections/7rk8Q1jPf)


**Assignments:** 
*Will be discussed in Thursday class*
* Production:
    * Due Feb. 7th (post documentation on blog): Using loops (for() or while()) in some way, along with everything that youâ€™ve learned so far, make a simple work of art. You may want to look at these old computer art magazines for inspiration, but you donâ€™t need to make your so elaborate. Scroll through and look for images:
       * [COMPUTER_GRAPHICS_AND_ART_Aug1977](http://dada.compart-bremen.de/docUploads/COMPUTER_GRAPHICS_AND_ART_Aug1977.pdf)
	      * [ProgrammInformation21_PI21](http://dada.compart-bremen.de/docUploads/ProgrammInformation21_PI21.pdf)
       * [COMPUTER_GRAPHICS_AND_ART_May1976](http://dada.compart-bremen.de/docUploads/COMPUTER_GRAPHICS_AND_ART_May1976.pdf)
* Reading:
    * Due Feb. 8: Watch [Casey Reasâ€™ Eyeo talk on chance operations](https://vimeo.com/45851523), be prepared to discuss **STUDENTS WILL BE PICKED IN CLASS**
        * [Guidance on this discussion format can be found here](https://github.com/MathuraMG/IntroductionToInteractiveMedia/blob/master/syllabus.md#student-led-discussions)
    * If you are new to functions or want to review, watch Dan Shiffmanâ€™s functions tutorials. There are four videos, each less than 10 minutes.
    * Watch at least the first four of Dan Shiffmanâ€™s Object Oriented Programming tutorials.
