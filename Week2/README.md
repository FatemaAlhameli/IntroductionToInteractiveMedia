**Animation, Conditionals, Loops**

## Class 2 - Part 1
### Feb 1 - 1:15pm - 3:55pm

**Recap**
* Variables
* frameCount and frameRate
* angleMode

**Topics covered in class**
* Functions - why do we need them? How to we make and use them?
  * `setup` and `draw` are functions that we are defining, but are being "called" by p5. ("Call" refers to actually running the lines of code inside the function)
  * `background`, `ellipse` are functions that are already defined that we are "calling" 
  * But why do we need them?
    * Modularity of code
    * Reusability of code
  * p5 has a couple more inbuild functions that we can use along with `setup` and `draw'
    * `mousePressed` - all lines of code inside this function will run when the mouse is pressed on the canvas
    * `keyPressed`
    * **TODO** : Go to the reference and check out what other similar functions we can use
  * Defining and calling custom functions
    * The syntax to define a function is  
    ```
      function functionName() {
        // code goes here
      }
    ```
    * to call a function you would just call it by the functions name
    ```
    functionName();
    ```
    * If the function has any arguments
    ```
    //function definition
    function functionName(arg1, arg2) {
      // code goes here
    }
    
    //calling the function
    functionName(val1, val2);
    ```
  * **TODO** : make a function that draws a car in a given x and y

* Conditionals
  * You would use a conditional (if-else) when you want certain blocks of code to run only when a certain condition is satisfied
  * Syntax is as follows
  ```
  if(customCondition) {
    //What code to run if the condition is satisfied
  }
  else {
    //What code to run if the above condition is not satisfied
  }
  ```
  * **TODO** : use if-else to draw a red ellipse when on the left half of the canvas, and draw a blue ellipse on the right half
  * Multiple conditions! In case of multiple conditions, we will use the `else if` conditional
  * **TODO** : Draw different coloured ellipses in each quadrant
  * We can now use the inbuilt variable - `mouseIsPressed`
  * **TODO** : update the previous code to draw only when the mouse is pressed
  * NOTE: `mouseIsPressed` is a boolean variable, it either provides true or false. If we use it in draw, we are always checking for the condition. Whereas, if we use the function `mousePressed`, then we are running the code inside it ONLY when the mosue is pressed.

* Loops
  * Loops are used to repeat code
  * There are 2 kinds of loops we will be looking at - `for` loops and `while` loops.

* While loops
  * The syntax for while loops is similar to `if` statement. The main difference is that, in a `if` block, the code inside runs once after the condition is checked. In a `while` loop, the code inside the while block runs as long as the condition is satisfied before leaving the code block.
  ``` 
  while(condition) {
    //code goes here
  }
  ```
  * **TODO**: use while loop to draw 10 ellipses on the screen
 * Be careful of infinite loops!!

## Class 2 - Part 2
### Feb 3 - 1:15pm - 2:30pm

**Topics covered in class**
* For loops
* Nested loops


**Examples for Class 2**



**Assignments:** 
*Will be discussed in Thursday class*
* Production:
    * Due Feb. 7th (post documentation on blog): Using loops (for() or while()) in some way, along with everything that youâ€™ve learned so far, make a simple work of art. You may want to look at these old computer art magazines for inspiration, but you donâ€™t need to make your so elaborate. Scroll through and look for images:
        * COMPUTER_GRAPHICS_AND_ART_Aug1977
        * ProgrammInformation21_PI21
        * COMPUTER_GRAPHICS_AND_ART_May1976
* Reading:
    * Due Feb. 8: Watch Casey Reasâ€™ Eyeo talk on chance operations, be prepared to discuss
        * Guidance on this discussion format can be found here
    * If you are new to functions or want to review, watch Dan Shiffmanâ€™s functions tutorials. There are four videos, each less than 10 minutes.
    * Watch at least the first four of Dan Shiffmanâ€™s Object Oriented Programming tutorials.
