**Animation, Conditionals, Loops**

## Class 2 - Part 1
### Feb 1 - 1:15pm - 3:55pm

**Submitting your homework**
* Create a sketch on the p5 editor
* Document your process, nxt steps, challenges, discoveries on github using markdown
* Make sure that this is done by 12 noon on Monday

**Recap**
* Variables
* frameCount and frameRate
* angleMode

**Topics covered in class**

* Conditionals
  * You would use a conditional (if-else) when you want certain blocks of code to run only when a certain condition is satisfied
  * Syntax is as follows
  ```
  if(customCondition) {
    //What code to run if the condition is satisfied
  }
  else {
    //What code to run if the above condition is not satisfied
  }
  ```
  * Try if else by drawing different coloured ellipses on different halves of the canvas
  * We can now use the `mouseIsPressed` variable to create interactions when the mouse is pressed
  * NOTE: You can also use the mousePressed() function. Note that there is a huge difference between the mouseIsPressed variable and the mousePressed() function: the variable mousePressed is true as long as any mouse button is pressed, while the function mousePressed() is called only once whenever a mouse button is pressed, no matter how long it's pressed for
  * **TODO** : if mouse is pressed, change the colour of the canvas! (Can pressing in different areas call for different background colours)
  * **TODO** : Continuing on the above, can we make a button?
  * Multiple conditions! In case of multiple conditions, we will use the `else if` conditional
  * **TODO** : can we make multiple buttons?
  * We can use the if statements to now make a bouncing ball!
  
* Loops
  * Loops are used to repeat code
  * There are 2 kinds of loops we will be looking at - `for` loops and `while` loops.
* For loops
* **TODO**: use while loop to draw 10 ellipses on the screen
* Nested loops
* **TODO**: use while loop to draw 100 ellipses on the screen!
* **Be careful of infinite loops!!**
* While loops - aquick look
  * The syntax for while loops is similar to `if` statement. The main difference is that, in a `if` block, the code inside runs once after the condition is checked. In a `while` loop, the code inside the while block runs as long as the condition is satisfied before leaving the code block.
  ``` 
  while(condition) {
    //code goes here
  }
  ```

 * Other Functions we can use!
   * random function
   * noise function
   * sin

## Class 2 - Part 2
### Feb 3 - 1:15pm - 2:30pm

**Topics covered in class**

* random function
* noise function
* sin


**Examples for Class 2**



**Assignments:** 
*Will be discussed in Thursday class*
* Production:
    * Due Feb. 7th (post documentation on blog): Using loops (for() or while()) in some way, along with everything that youâ€™ve learned so far, make a simple work of art. You may want to look at these old computer art magazines for inspiration, but you donâ€™t need to make your so elaborate. Scroll through and look for images:
        * COMPUTER_GRAPHICS_AND_ART_Aug1977
        * ProgrammInformation21_PI21
        * COMPUTER_GRAPHICS_AND_ART_May1976
* Reading:
    * Due Feb. 8: Watch Casey Reasâ€™ Eyeo talk on chance operations, be prepared to discuss
        * Guidance on this discussion format can be found here
    * If you are new to functions or want to review, watch Dan Shiffmanâ€™s functions tutorials. There are four videos, each less than 10 minutes.
    * Watch at least the first four of Dan Shiffmanâ€™s Object Oriented Programming tutorials.
