# Introduction to Interactive Media

## Weekly Schedule

### Week 1 (Jan 25 & Jan 27)
**Primitive shapes, Programming concepts**

* Create an account on the P5js editor website.

*Assignments:*
* Production:
    * Due Jan 31 (post documentation on blog): Make a self-portrait using P5js.
        * The portrait must be entirely created by your code i.e. you must not interact with your computer while the portrait is being made (e.g. no drawing using the mouse)
        * The portrait does not need to be dynamic (i.e. it does not need to change while we look at it)
        * The portrait does not need to be realistic. The purpose is to practice using the simple drawing functions.

### Week 6 (Mar 1 & Mar 3)
**Sound (download files for use in class)**

*Assignments:*

* Production:
    * Complete Midterm

---

### Week 7 (Mar 8 & Mar 10)
**Midterm due – Mar. 10**

*Assignments (do this before Mar. 24):*

* Reading:
    * Sparkfun breadboard tutorial
    * Microcontrollers, the basics
    * Digital Input & Output
    * Prepare a space for working with electronics
    * Have your kits ready to use in class
    * Install the Arduino IDE from here. If you are on Windows choose the Windows Installer.
    * In your kit is a bundle of jumper wires with a very tight ziptie that must be carefully removed. Please do this before class because it may take you a while to find the right tool. A sharp pair of scissors should work. A knife might damage the wires and hurt you.

Be careful not to damage the wires or yourselves!

### Week 8 (Mar. 24)
**Introduction to Electricity, arduino digital input & output**

*Assignments:*

* Production:
    * Due Mar. 28 (post documentation on blog): Create an unusual switch that doesn’t require the use of your hands. Use Arduino digital input and output for the interaction.

        * A Brief Rant on the Future of Interaction Design
        * A follow-up article
    * Read about the voltage divider. Don’t worry about the theory too much or the section on level shifting. The important thing is to absorb a little of the concept of a voltage divider.

*Assignments:*

* Production:
    * Due Apr. 11 (post documentation on blog) – group assignment (2 people per group):  Make a musical instrument

---

### Week 11 (Apr 12 & Apr 14)
**Serial Communication, introduce Final Project**

*Assignments:*

* Production:
    * Due Apr. 18 (each person, not just one for a group, should post code for each exercise, and video of just the LED lighting up with the ball bouncing) Work in the groups from class to finish the three in-class examples exercises:
        1. make something that uses only one sensor  on arduino and makes the ellipse in p5 move on the horizontal axis, in the middle of the screen, and nothing on arduino is controlled by p5
        1. make something that controls the LED brightness from p5
        1. take the gravity wind example (https://editor.p5js.org/aaronsherwood/sketches/I7iQrNCul) and make it so every time the ball bounces one led lights up and then turns off, and you can control the wind from one analog sensor
    * Due Apr. 18 (post documentation on blog): Write a preliminary concept for your final project, which must incorporate both Arduino and P5.
        * Final project prompt (examples are listed on syllabus page)
            * Create a physically interactive system of your choice that relies on a multimedia computer for some sort of processing or data analysis. The Final should use BOTH P5 AND Arduino. Your focus should be on careful and timely sensing of the relevant actions of the person or people that you’re designing this for, and on clear, prompt, and effective responses. Any interactive system is going to involve systems of listening, thinking, and speaking from both parties. Whether it involves one cycle or many, the exchange should be engaging. You may work alone or in groups.
* Reading
    * Due Apr. 19 (be prepared to discuss): Design Meets Disability
