# Getting ready for finals
Here's some pointers, tips to keep in mind as you come close to finishing up your mid-term

### Keeping your code clean
Some basic pointers to have clean code
* Create meaningful variable names
* Create meaningful function names
* Move your class definitions to seperate files
* If you have a lot of "helper" functions defined - i.e functions that do calculations and other such small tasks, you can move them to a seperate js file as well **REMEMBER** to include these js file in index.html
* If you have more than one image/sound/asset, move it into a folder called assets and add them there
* As much as possible, keep all your global variables declaration on the top of the file
* Add comments for each chunk of code. You do not neeed to add a d comment for each line. But a comment describing chunks of code in 5-7 words is enough. What is a chunk of code? Well, a function is a chunk of code, a nested for loop going through your sprites can be considered a chunk

### Making canvas full screen
To make your canvas the size of your screen you can simply say `createCanvas(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight)`

### Moving your canvas to the center
* If you are making a smaller canvas, you would typically like to keep it in the center of your screen. You can do that by adding some code in your style.css. I have included the code required for the same in the below editor link

# Prepping for next module!
* Head over to the bookstore and pick up your kit. It will contain the Arduino and other hardware materials that you would need. Make sure to pick it up **THIS WEEK**
