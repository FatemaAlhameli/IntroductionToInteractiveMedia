## Introduction to Electricity, Arduino, Digital I/O 

### Housekeeping
* Attendance
* Do you have your kit?
* Arduino IDE?
* Install this -> https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
* (if you want to use online editor https://docs.arduino.cc/cloud/web-editor/tutorials/getting-started/getting-started-web-editor )

### Electricity
* Refers to the flow of electrons
* Electrons want to move from place of higher potential energy to place of lower potential energy
    * Like a rock or water falling from a height
    * Unlike a rock or water, electricity can only travel in a conductor

### Circuit
* What is a circuit - a path for electricity to flow
* Typically contains 
    * Power supply (battery, wall charger, USB port) - we will be using the Arduino
    * An output - something that uses the electrical energy and converts it into another form of energy- eg - light -LED, movement -motors
    * Something to control the flow of energy, eg - switch
    * We can also use a resistor to control the amount of power passing through the output 
* The main values we look at in a circuit - Current, Voltage, and Resistance. The 3 of them are related by Ohm’s Law - V = I*R. This is important. Remember this, memorize it, say it in your sleep.
* All components have a voltage across them, current flowing through them, and an internal resistance. *We will go into the details of Ohm’s Law the next week*
* We always draw schematics for the circuits we build - schematics basically refers to symbolic representation of the circuit (similar to blueprints for a building) (Image courtesy - https://makeabilitylab.github.io/)

* Let’s draw out our first circuit
* Let’s also take a quick look at how a breadboard works

* TODO : We can connects the LED directly to the power source first and see what happens. We’re also going to add a resistor to reduce the voltage across the LED
* TODO :  what if we want to turn this off?
