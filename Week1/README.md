**Assignments:** 
*Will be discussed in Thursday class*
* Production: 
    * Due Jan 31 (post documentation on githu): Make a self-portrait using P5js. ([How to add images in markdown](https://github.com/MathuraMG/Resources/blob/main/Embedding-images-in-markdown.md)) | [Github for documentation](https://github.com/MathuraMG/Resources/blob/main/Github-for-documentation.md) | [Markdown](https://markdown-it.github.io/)
        * The portrait must be entirely created by your code i.e. you must not interact with your computer while the portrait is being made (e.g. no drawing using the mouse)
        * The portrait does not need to be dynamic (i.e. it does not need to change while we look at it)
        * The portrait does not need to be realistic. The purpose is to practice using the simple drawing functions.
* Reading:
    * Due Feb 1:
        * Getting Started with P5js
        * Coordinate systems and space
